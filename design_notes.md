# OpenLifter WebSocket Server Implementation Plan

## Development Roadmap
We need to address all these items eventually. Let's start with the most foundational element - completing the API implementation - and then work through the rest in a logical order:

### 1. ✅ Complete API Implementation
- [x] Fix server compilation issues
- [x] Implement proper configuration loading
- [x] Get server running successfully
- [x] Implement missing endpoints from the spec (PUBLISH_MEET, SERVER_PULL, etc.)
- [x] Complete the API functionality

### 2. ✅ Error Handling & Conflict Resolution
- [x] Enhance error handling for network interruptions
- [x] Implement proper conflict resolution based on priority levels
- [x] Add validation for all incoming messages

### 3. ⬜ Data Recovery Mechanisms
- [ ] Implement state recovery when clients or server go offline
- [ ] Ensure proper event sequence tracking and replay
- [ ] Test recovery scenarios

### 4. ⬜ Integration with OpenLifter Frontend
- [ ] Create the "Live (Advanced)" tab components
- [ ] Build WebSocket integration with the Redux store
- [ ] Connect UI events to WebSocket messages

### 5. ⬜ Security Enhancements
- [ ] Review and strengthen authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting and other protections
- [ ] Implement proper session expiry

### 6. ⬜ Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive API docs
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Add load testing

### 7. ⬜ Production Readiness
- [ ] Complete Docker configuration
- [ ] Add monitoring & logging
- [ ] Create deployment scripts

### 8. ⬜ Advanced Features
- [ ] Livestream overlay support
- [ ] Meet finalization
- [ ] Results submission to OPL

This approach starts with the core functionality and progressively builds toward more advanced features and production readiness. Since the API implementation is foundational, let's identify what endpoints are still missing or incomplete based on the spec and implement those first.

## API Endpoint Analysis: Comparing Spec to Implementation

Based on the original design specification and our demo, here's an analysis of which WebSocket API endpoints are implemented versus which ones still need to be added:

### Currently Implemented

1. **Meet Creation**
   - ✅ CREATE_MEET (client -> server)
   - ✅ MEET_CREATED (server -> client)

2. **Meet Joining**
   - ✅ JOIN_MEET (client -> server)
   - ✅ MEET_JOINED (server -> client)

3. **Update Handling**
   - ✅ UPDATE_INIT (client -> server)
   - ✅ UPDATE_ACK (server -> client)
   - ✅ Basic session validation
   - ✅ UPDATE_RELAY (server -> client)

4. **Meet Publishing**
   - ✅ PUBLISH_MEET (client -> server)
   - ✅ PUBLISH_ACK (server -> client)

5. **Resynchronization Mechanism**
   - ✅ CLIENT_PULL (client -> server)
   - ✅ SERVER_PULL (server -> client)

6. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ JOIN_REJECTED (server -> client)
   - ✅ UPDATE_REJECTED (server -> client)
   - ✅ MALFORMED_MESSAGE (server -> client)
   - ✅ UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_TYPE (server -> client)
   - ✅ INVALID_SESSION (server -> client)

7. **Conflict Resolution**
   - ✅ Proper handling of conflicting updates based on client priority
   - ✅ Message validation

8. **Network Resilience**
   - ✅ Reconnection attempts after connection drops
   - ✅ Graceful handling of server restarts
   - ✅ Retry logic for message delivery

### Next Steps

The next priorities should be:

1. **Data Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Implement state recovery when clients or server go offline
   - Ensure proper event sequence tracking and replay
   - Test recovery scenarios

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Review and strengthen authentication
   - Add rate limiting and other protections
   - Implement proper session expiry

Let's add some pre-commit hooks to ensure that everything passes the linter and the tests
