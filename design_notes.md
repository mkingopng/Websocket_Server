# OpenLifter WebSocket Server Implementation Plan

## Development Roadmap

This document tracks the development progress of the WebSocket server implementation. All items are organized in priority order with their completion status.

### 1. Core API Implementation
- [x] Fix server compilation issues
- [x] Implement proper configuration loading
- [x] Get server running successfully
- [x] Implement missing endpoints from the spec
  - [x] CREATE_MEET (client -> server)
  - [x] MEET_CREATED (server -> client)
  - [x] JOIN_MEET (client -> server)
  - [x] MEET_JOINED (server -> client)
  - [x] UPDATE_INIT (client -> server)
  - [x] UPDATE_ACK (server -> client)
  - [x] UPDATE_RELAY (server -> client)
  - [x] PUBLISH_MEET (client -> server)
  - [x] PUBLISH_ACK (server -> client)
  - [x] CLIENT_PULL (client -> server)
  - [x] SERVER_PULL (server -> client)
- [x] Basic session validation
- [x] Complete the API functionality

### 2. Error Handling & Conflict Resolution
- [x] Enhance error handling for network interruptions
- [x] Implement error response types
  - [x] JOIN_REJECTED (server -> client)
  - [x] UPDATE_REJECTED (server -> client)
  - [x] MALFORMED_MESSAGE (server -> client)
  - [x] UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_TYPE (server -> client)
  - [x] INVALID_SESSION (server -> client)
- [x] Implement proper conflict resolution based on priority levels
- [x] Add validation for all incoming messages
- [x] Add reconnection attempts after connection drops
- [x] Add graceful handling of server restarts
- [x] Implement retry logic for message delivery

### 3. Data Recovery Mechanisms
- [x] Implement state recovery protocol (message types and handlers)
- [x] Add client state recovery response handling
- [x] Implement conflict resolution during recovery based on priority
- [x] Fix compilation issues with WebSocket handler
- [x] Update UpdateWithServerSeq struct usage
- [x] Implement automated state inconsistency detection
- [x] Add proper sequence tracking with gap detection
- [x] Test recovery scenarios with multiple clients

### 4. Security Enhancements
- [x] Review and strengthen authentication
- [x] Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [x] Implement proper session expiry
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Review authentication flow for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

### 5. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
  - [ ] Document all WebSocket message types with examples
  - [ ] Create sequence diagrams showing client-server interactions
  - [ ] Document error handling and recovery flows
- [x] WebSocket flow integration tests
- [ ] Write additional integration tests
- [ ] Implement load testing scripts
  - [ ] Simulate multiple concurrent clients
  - [ ] Test different connection patterns (stable vs. intermittent)
  - [ ] Test network degradation scenarios
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and limitations

### 6. Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Enhance logging for production environments
  - [ ] Implement structured logging with proper context
  - [ ] Add log rotation and management
  - [ ] Configure different log levels for environments
- [ ] Complete the metrics implementation
  - [ ] Add metrics for conflict resolution
  - [ ] Add metrics for storage operations
  - [ ] Add metrics for authentication
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
  - [ ] Comprehensive health status checks
  - [ ] Readiness and liveness checks for container orchestration

### 7. Deployment and Data Management
- [ ] Finalize Dockerfile and container setup
  - [ ] Implement multi-stage build for smaller images
  - [ ] Configure properly for production
  - [ ] Add health checks for container orchestration
- [ ] Create deployment instructions for different environments
  - [ ] Docker Compose setup
  - [ ] Kubernetes manifests (if needed)
  - [ ] Cloud deployment options
- [ ] Implement backup and restore procedures
  - [ ] Create scripts for backing up meet data
  - [ ] Document restore procedure for data recovery
  - [ ] Add data retention policies

### 8. Integration with OpenLifter Frontend
- [ ] Create the "Live (Advanced)" tab components
- [ ] Build WebSocket integration with the Redux store
- [ ] Connect UI events to WebSocket messages
- [ ] Document integration steps for OpenLifter frontend
- [ ] Create example code for handling common scenarios

### 9. Advanced Features
- [ ] Livestream overlay support
- [ ] Meet finalization
- [ ] Results submission to OPL
- [ ] Create polished demo script
- [ ] Prepare benchmarks and comparison with alternatives

## Project Structure Improvements

- [x] Resolve duplicate data directories:
  - [x] Consolidate `crates/backend-lib/data/current-meets`, `data/current-meets`
  - [x] Consolidate `crates/backend-lib/data/finished-meets`, `data/finished-meets`

- [x] Consider renaming files with common names to be more specific:
  - [x] Test files could include the name of the module being tested
