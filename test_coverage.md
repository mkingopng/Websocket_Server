## Test Improvement Notes
- The WebSocket handler has seen significant improvement in test coverage, but complex logic around reconnection and conflict resolution needs more targeted tests.
- We've added initial WebSocket router tests, increasing coverage from 0% to 4.82%, but significant parts remain untested.
- The auth modules need more comprehensive testing, especially for password handling.
- Storage tests show good coverage (76.81%) but could benefit from more edge case testing.
- End-to-end tests should be expanded to cover real-world scenarios more completely.
