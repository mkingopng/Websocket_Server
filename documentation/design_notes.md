  - [x] String content sanitization
- [ ] Review authentication flow for vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Identify potential authentication bypass techniques
  - [ ] Assess token generation security
  - [ ] Audit session management
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

  - [ ] Implement generic error messages for production

### 5. Testing
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests
  - [x] Input validation tests
  - [x] Authentication tests
  - [x] Message handling tests
  - [ ] Add more edge case tests
  - [ ] Add performance-related tests

- [ ] Write additional integration tests
- [ ] Implement load testing scripts
  - [ ] Simulate multiple concurrent clients
  - [ ] Test different connection patterns (stable vs. intermittent)
  - [ ] Test network degradation scenarios
- [ ] simulation tests

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
  - [ ] Document all WebSocket message types with examples
  - [ ] Create sequence diagrams showing client-server interactions
  - [ ] Document error handling and recovery flows
- [ ] Document performance characteristics and limitations

### 7. Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Enhance logging for production environments
  - [ ] Implement structured logging with proper context
  - [ ] Add log rotation and management
  - [ ] Configure different log levels for environments
- [ ] Complete the metrics implementation
  - [ ] Add metrics for conflict resolution
  - [ ] Add metrics for storage operations
  - [ ] Add metrics for authentication
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
  - [ ] Comprehensive health status checks
  - [ ] Readiness and liveness checks for container orchestration

### 8. Deployment and Data Management
- [ ] Finalize Dockerfile and container setup
  - [ ] Implement multi-stage build for smaller images
  - [ ] Configure properly for production
  - [ ] Add health checks for container orchestration
- [ ] Create deployment instructions for different environments
  - [ ] Docker Compose setup
  - [ ] Kubernetes manifests (if needed)
  - [ ] Cloud deployment options
- [ ] Implement backup and restore procedures
  - [ ] Create scripts for backing up meet data
  - [ ] Document restore procedure for data recovery
  - [ ] Add data retention policies

### 9. Integration with OpenLifter Frontend
- [ ] Create the "Live (Advanced)" tab components
- [ ] Build WebSocket integration with the Redux store
- [ ] Connect UI events to WebSocket messages
- [ ] Document integration steps for OpenLifter frontend
- [ ] Create example code for handling common scenarios

### 10. Advanced Features
- [ ] Livestream overlay support
- [ ] Meet finalization
- [ ] Results submission to OPL
- [ ] Create polished demo script
- [ ] Prepare benchmarks and comparison with alternatives

### 11. Project Structure Improvements
- [x] Resolve duplicate data directories:
  - [x] Consolidate `crates/backend-lib/data/current-meets`, `data/current-meets`
  - [x] Consolidate `crates/backend-lib/data/finished-meets`, `data/finished-meets`
- [x] Consider renaming files with common names to be more specific:
  - [x] Test files could include the name of the module being tested

### 11. Code Quality Improvements
- [x] Modernize code with latest Rust features
  - [x] Replace deprecated `lazy_static` with `std::sync::LazyLock`
  - [x] Use modern string formatting with inline variables
  - [x] Improve error handling with `anyhow` and `thiserror`
- [x] Ensure all code passes clippy checks with zero warnings
- [x] Fix borrowing and ownership issues in WebSocket handlers
- [x] Implement comprehensive validation for all user inputs
