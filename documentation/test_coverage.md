# WebSocket Server Test Coverage

This document tracks the current test coverage of the WebSocket Server API and outlines areas that need additional testing.

## Test Directory Structure
We've created a new test directory structure to better organize tests:
```
tests/
├── e2e/               # End-to-end tests (shell scripts)
│   ├── websocket_test.sh
│   └── network_resilience_test.sh
├── integration/       # Integration tests
├── performance/       # Performance tests
├── unit/              # Unit tests
└── README.md          # Documentation
```
**Note:** The test structure is set up, but more work is needed to properly integrate it with the build system. 
Currently, unit tests still exist in their respective modules, and the new test files are skeletons that need to be adapted to the actual API.

## Current Coverage (as of latest tarpaulin report)
Overall coverage: **39.85%** (326/818 lines covered)

## Test Improvement Notes
- The WebSocket handler has seen significant improvement in test coverage, but complex logic around reconnection and conflict resolution needs more targeted tests.
- We've added initial WebSocket router tests, increasing coverage from 0% to 4.82%, but significant parts remain untested.
- New unit tests have been added for:
  - Password authentication
  - Error handling
  - Rate limiting
  - Meet operations
- Existing tests have been relocated to the new test structure:
  - Config tests
  - Middleware tests
- Integration tests are now being developed in the new structure as well.
- The test directory structure has been reorganized:
  - `tests/unit/`: Unit tests for individual components
  - `tests/integration/`: Integration tests for component interactions
  - `tests/e2e/`: End-to-end tests (including shell scripts)
  - `tests/performance/`: Performance benchmarks (skeleton implemented)
- Further improvements should focus on:
  - Handlers/live.rs (0% coverage)
  - Session management (44% coverage)
  - WebSocket router (4.82% coverage)
- **Action items**:
  - Fix integration of the new test structure with the build system
  - Adapt test skeletons to match the actual API 

--------
Recall: my rule in all cases is that we don't want work arounds to just make the tests pass. We want to find the root cause thats causing failure or time-outs and deal with the root cause. Its almost always caused by a problem. Please take note for future reference

Now that some of the tests are passing, lets:
- remove any time-outs from the tests. instead of using time-outs, we need to analyse why the tests are failing/hanging and deal with the root cause
- deal with any tests that are current commented out or skipped, eg `config_tests.rs`, `auth_flow_tests.rs`
- build out any tests that have comments saying "skeleton" eg `meet_tests.rs`, `ws_router_tests.rs`
- check test coverage using tarpaulin and update `test_coverage.md` file
- include integration tests in pre-commit hooks
- include any other tests from our new test suite that are appropriate for precommit hooks
- run the precommit hooks
